The characteristic concentric rings on the lesions are a key diagnostic feature.  The severity suggests the disease has progressed considerably.

**1. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**

* **Remove and Destroy Infected Plants:**  Immediately remove all severely infected plants, including foliage and stems.  Do not compost these; bag them and dispose of them in a landfill or burn them (check local regulations). This prevents further spread of the fungus.
* **Improve Air Circulation:** Prune lower leaves and ensure adequate spacing between plants to improve airflow.  This reduces humidity, a key factor in fungal growth.
* **Apply a Fungicide:** Apply a fungicide registered for early blight control in your region.  Copper-based fungicides, strobilurins, or DMI fungicides are often effective.  Follow label instructions meticulously regarding application rate, frequency, and safety precautions.  Consider a preventative fungicide application to healthy plants as well.
* **Monitor Closely:** Regularly inspect plants for new signs of infection.  Early detection is crucial for effective management.

**2. PREVENTION STRATEGIES:**

* **Crop Rotation:** Rotate crops annually to break the disease cycle. Avoid planting Solanaceous crops (tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, eggplants) in the same location for at least 3-4 years.
* **Disease-Resistant Varieties:** Choose tomato or pepper varieties known for resistance to early blight. Check seed catalogs or consult with local agricultural extension offices for recommendations.
* **Sanitation:** Clean up all plant debris at the end of the growing season.  Remove weeds, as they can harbor the fungus.  Proper sanitation minimizes the overwintering of the pathogen.
* **Seed Treatment:** Use certified disease-free seeds or treat seeds with a fungicide before planting.
* **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid overhead irrigation, which promotes leaf wetness and fungal growth.  Use drip irrigation or soaker hoses to minimize leaf wetness.
* **Soil Drainage:** Ensure well-drained soil to prevent waterlogging, which favors fungal development.

**3. COST ESTIMATES:**

Costs will vary significantly depending on the farm size, chosen fungicide, and availability of labor.  However, a rough estimate includes:

* **Fungicide:** $50-$200 (depending on the size of the farm and the type of fungicide used).
* **Labor for removal and disposal of infected plants:** $50-$200 (depending on the farm size and labor costs).
* **Replacement plants (if necessary):** $20-$100 (depending on the number of plants lost).
* **Disease-resistant seeds (for future planting):** $20-$50.


**4. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:**

* **Biological Control:** Explore the use of biofungicides, such as those containing *Bacillus subtilis* or *Trichoderma* species.  These are environmentally friendly alternatives to chemical fungicides but may require more frequent applications and might not be as effective as chemical control in severe infestations.
* **Cultural Practices:**  Strengthening plant health through proper fertilization and watering can enhance the plant's natural resistance to disease.  This approach is preventative rather than curative.

**5. WARNING SIGNS:**

* **Small, dark brown lesions:** Initially, lesions appear as small, dark brown spots on leaves.
* **Concentric rings:** The characteristic target-like rings are a key diagnostic feature.
* **Leaf drop:** Severe infection leads to premature leaf drop.
* **Stem lesions:**  Lesions can also develop on stems, causing weakening and eventual collapse of the plant.
* **Reduced fruit yield and quality:** Infected plants produce fewer and smaller fruits of lower quality.
* **Rapid spread:** The disease can spread rapidly under favorable conditions (high humidity and warm temperatures).

Always consult with your local agricultural extension office or a certified plant pathologist for specific recommendations tailored to your region and crop.  Proper identification of the disease is crucial for effective treatment.  Always follow label instructions when using any pesticide or fungicide.
