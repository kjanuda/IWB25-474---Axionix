The severity suggests a late-stage infection.  The cause isn't definitively shown in the image, but several possibilities exist.

**1. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**

* **Isolate Infected Plants:** Immediately remove and destroy (burn if possible, otherwise bag and dispose of properly) all severely affected plants to prevent further spread.  Do not compost infected material.
* **Assess the Extent of Damage:**  Conduct a thorough field survey to determine the total area affected and the severity of the infection across the field. This will inform subsequent decisions.
* **Emergency Fungicide Application:** Apply a broad-spectrum fungicide registered for use on the specific crop and approved for the region.  Follow label instructions precisely regarding application rate, timing, and safety precautions. Choose a product with multiple modes of action to minimize the risk of fungicide resistance development.  Consider a preventative application to unaffected areas as well.
* **Improve Air Circulation:** If possible, prune or thin the canopy to improve air circulation and reduce humidity, which favors fungal growth. This is crucial for preventing further spread.
* **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation if possible; switch to drip irrigation to minimize leaf wetness duration.  Adjust irrigation scheduling to avoid excessive moisture in the soil.

**2. PREVENTION STRATEGIES:**

* **Crop Rotation:**  Rotate crops annually to disrupt the life cycle of soilborne pathogens. Avoid planting Solanaceous crops in the same area for at least 3-4 years.
* **Disease-Resistant Varieties:** Select and plant disease-resistant cultivars specifically bred for resistance to common fungal diseases prevalent in the area. Consult with local agricultural extension services for recommendations.
* **Sanitation:**  Clean up all plant debris at the end of the growing season.  This removes potential overwintering sites for pathogens.  Regularly disinfect tools and equipment used in the field.
* **Soil Health:** Maintain healthy soil through practices like cover cropping, composting, and avoiding excessive tillage. Healthy soil promotes plant vigor and resilience to disease.
* **Seed Treatment:** Use certified disease-free seeds or treat seeds with appropriate fungicides before planting.
* **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor the crop for early signs of disease. Early detection allows for timely intervention and minimizes damage.

**3. COST ESTIMATES:**

Costs will vary significantly depending on the size of the affected area, the specific fungicide used, labor costs, and the cost of replacement plants (if necessary).  A rough estimate might be:

* **Fungicide:** $50-$200+ per acre (depending on product and application method).
* **Labor:** $50-$150+ per acre (for removal of infected plants, application of fungicide, and other tasks).
* **Replacement Plants (if significant loss):**  Highly variable, depending on the crop and quantity needed.
* **Seed Treatment (Preventative):**  Relatively low cost, typically a few dollars per pound of seed.

**4. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:**

* **Biocontrol Agents:** Explore the use of biocontrol agents (beneficial microorganisms) that can suppress fungal pathogens.  This is a more environmentally friendly approach but may require more time to show results.
* **Organic Fungicides:** Consider using organic fungicides like copper-based sprays or neem oil.  These are less toxic than synthetic fungicides but may be less effective against severe infections.


**5. WARNING SIGNS:**

Early warning signs of leaf blight/fungal infections vary depending on the specific pathogen, but common indicators include:

* **Small, discolored spots:** Initially, lesions may appear as small, water-soaked spots on leaves.
* **Leaf discoloration:**  Leaves may turn yellow, brown, or black, depending on the pathogen.
* **Wilting:**  Affected plants may wilt, even with adequate water.
* **Premature defoliation:**  Severe infections can lead to premature leaf drop.
* **Fruit rot:** In some cases, the infection can spread to the fruit, causing rot.
* **White or gray mold:**  Some fungal infections produce visible mold on leaves and stems.

**Disclaimer:**  This advice is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute professional agricultural advice.  It is crucial to consult with local agricultural extension services or experienced plant pathologists for accurate diagnosis and tailored recommendations based on specific circumstances and regional conditions.  Always follow label instructions when using any pesticides or other agricultural chemicals.
