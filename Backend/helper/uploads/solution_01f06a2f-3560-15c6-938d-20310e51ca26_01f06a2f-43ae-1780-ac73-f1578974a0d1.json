This is a serious problem that needs immediate attention.  My analysis, based on 20+ years of experience, follows:


**1. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**

* **Isolate affected plants:**  Prevent further spread by immediately isolating the affected plants. This might involve physically removing them from the field and destroying them by burning (if regulations allow) or burying them deeply.  Do not compost infected plants.
* **Assess the severity:** Carefully inspect the entire field to determine the extent of the infestation.  Note the percentage of plants affected and the severity of the blight on individual plants.  This helps determine the next steps.
* **Improve air circulation:** If possible, thin out the plants to improve air circulation.  This reduces humidity, a key factor in fungal disease development.
* **Apply a fungicide:**  A broad-spectrum fungicide with a proven track record against leaf blight in Solanaceae crops is needed.  **Crucially**, identify the specific pathogen causing the blight through a laboratory test (see below).  This allows for targeted treatment with maximum efficacy and minimizes resistance development.  Follow label instructions meticulously regarding application rates and safety precautions.
* **Water management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, which spreads the disease.  Switch to drip irrigation or other methods that minimize leaf wetness.

**2. PREVENTION STRATEGIES:**

* **Crop rotation:** Rotate crops annually to break the disease cycle. Avoid planting Solanaceae crops in the same location for several years.
* **Disease-resistant varieties:**  Select and plant cultivars known for resistance to common leaf blight pathogens in your region.  Seed suppliers can provide this information.
* **Sanitation:**  Clean up all plant debris from the previous season to remove potential overwintering sites for the pathogen.  This includes removing weeds that may harbor the disease.
* **Soil health:** Maintain healthy soil with good drainage.  Healthy soil promotes strong plant growth, increasing resistance to diseases.  Consider soil testing and amend as necessary.
* **Seed treatment:** Use certified disease-free seeds treated with fungicides.
* **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the field for early signs of disease. Early detection allows for prompt intervention and limits damage.


**3. COST ESTIMATES:**

Costs will vary depending on the farm's size, the severity of the infestation, and the specific solutions employed.  A rough estimate includes:

* **Fungicide:** $50-$200+ per acre, depending on the type and application method.
* **Labor:**  $50-$150+ per acre for plant removal, thinning, and fungicide application.
* **Seed replacement (if necessary):**  Variable depending on seed cost and acreage.
* **Laboratory testing for pathogen identification:** $50-$150 per sample.
* **Soil testing (if necessary):** $20-$50 per sample.


**4. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:**

* **Biological control:** Explore the use of biofungicides (e.g., Bacillus subtilis) as a more environmentally friendly alternative to chemical fungicides.  Efficacy may vary depending on the pathogen and environmental conditions.
* **Resistant rootstocks:** If applicable, using resistant rootstocks can improve plant resilience to diseases.
* **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):**  Implement an IPM strategy that combines cultural practices, biological control, and judicious use of chemical controls. This minimizes reliance on chemicals while effectively managing the disease.


**5. WARNING SIGNS:**

* **Initial symptoms:** Small, water-soaked lesions on leaves, often starting on lower leaves.
* **Lesion progression:** Lesions enlarge, becoming brown or black and necrotic.
* **Leaf wilting and defoliation:** Severely infected plants wilt and lose leaves.
* **Reduced yield:**  Significant yield loss is a clear indication of a serious problem.
* **Rapid spread:**  Quick spread of the disease across the field indicates a high infection pressure.


**Disclaimer:** This analysis is for informational purposes only.  Accurate diagnosis and treatment require professional consultation with a plant pathologist or agricultural extension specialist.  Always follow the label instructions of any pesticide or fungicide used.  Improper application can lead to environmental damage and health risks.  The image provided lacks sufficient resolution for definitive diagnosis, therefore laboratory testing is crucial.
