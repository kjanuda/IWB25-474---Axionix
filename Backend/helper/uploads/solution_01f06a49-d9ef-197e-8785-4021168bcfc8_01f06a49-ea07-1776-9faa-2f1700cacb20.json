Therefore, I cannot perform an image analysis to confirm pest presence or assess the severity of the leaf curling and yellowing. My advice will be based on the provided information alone.  However,  the described symptoms strongly suggest a combination of environmental stress and potential nutrient imbalance.

**Problem:** Tomato plants in a polyethylene greenhouse exhibiting leaf curl, yellowing edges, reduced flowering, likely due to excess heat, humidity, poor ventilation, and potential nutrient imbalance.

**1. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**

* **Improve Ventilation:** Immediately increase greenhouse ventilation.  Open vents, sidewalls, and roof vents (if available) to reduce humidity and heat buildup. If the greenhouse lacks adequate ventilation, consider installing fans to circulate air.  Prioritize this step – high humidity and heat are immediate threats.
* **Monitor Temperature and Humidity:** Install a reliable thermometer and hygrometer to continuously monitor greenhouse conditions. Aim for optimal tomato growing conditions (ideally 65-80°F (18-27°C) daytime and 55-65°F (13-18°C) nighttime, with relative humidity below 70%).
* **Visual Inspection:** Carefully examine plants for pests (whiteflies and aphids are likely culprits given the symptoms).  Look on the undersides of leaves.
* **Water Management:** Adjust watering schedule based on soil moisture. Avoid overwatering, which exacerbates humidity problems.  Ensure good drainage.

**2. PREVENTION STRATEGIES:**

* **Greenhouse Design/Upgrade:** For future crops, consider improvements to greenhouse ventilation (larger vents, fans, automated ventilation systems).  Consider using shade cloth during peak sun hours to reduce heat buildup.
* **Nutrient Management:** Conduct a soil test to determine nutrient levels.  Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization; focus on balanced fertilization using a formula appropriate for tomatoes.  Follow package instructions carefully.
* **Pest Monitoring:** Implement regular pest scouting. Use yellow sticky traps to monitor whitefly and aphid populations.  Introduce beneficial insects (e.g., ladybugs) for biological control.
* **Crop Rotation:** Rotate crops yearly to break pest and disease cycles.
* **Hygiene:** Maintain good greenhouse hygiene. Remove infected leaves promptly and dispose of them properly to prevent further spread.


**3. COST ESTIMATES:**

This is highly dependent on your location and resources.  Costs could include:

* **Thermometer & Hygrometer:** $20-$50
* **Fans:** $50-$200+ (depending on size and type)
* **Soil Testing Kit:** $10-$30 (or lab testing, which is more expensive)
* **Fertilizer:** $10-$50+ (depending on type and quantity)
* **Beneficial Insects:** $10-$30+
* **Yellow Sticky Traps:** $10-$20
* **Shade Cloth:** $50-$200+ (depending on size and quality)
* **Greenhouse Upgrades (vents, etc.):**  Variable, potentially hundreds or thousands of dollars.

**4. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:**

* **Organic Pest Control:** Consider using neem oil or insecticidal soap to control pests organically.  Always follow label instructions carefully.
* **Foliar Feeding:** Supplement with foliar feeding of micronutrients (ensure proper dilution) if a nutrient deficiency is suspected after soil testing.
* **Growth Regulators:** In severe cases, plant growth regulators might be considered (consult a local agricultural extension office for advice; this is not a first-line approach).


**5. WARNING SIGNS:**

* **Rapid wilting:** Indicates severe water stress or root problems.
* **Extensive leaf drop:**  Suggests serious disease or nutrient deficiency.
* **Presence of significant pest infestation:**  Large numbers of whiteflies or aphids will require immediate and aggressive control measures.
* **Fruit drop:**  Indicates stress, nutrient deficiency, or disease.
* **Stem lesions or discoloration:** Could indicate disease.

I strongly recommend contacting your local agricultural extension office or a qualified horticultural consultant for personalized recommendations and on-site assessment, especially given the limitations of not being able to analyze the provided image and audio files directly.
