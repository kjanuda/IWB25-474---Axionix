/**
 * Constants for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect scopes.
 * These scopes define the level of access that the client application
 * is requesting from the authorization server.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Scopes are space-separated strings that represent different permissions.
 * The 'openid' scope is required for OpenID Connect flows, while other
 * scopes provide access to different resources or user information.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Requesting OpenID Connect authentication
 * const scope = [ScopeConstants.OPENID];
 *
 * // Requesting profile information
 * const scopes = [ScopeConstants.OPENID, ScopeConstants.PROFILE];
 * ```
