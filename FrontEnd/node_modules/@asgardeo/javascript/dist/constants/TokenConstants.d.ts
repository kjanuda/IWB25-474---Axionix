/**
 * Constants related to OIDC token management and storage.
 * This object contains configuration values and storage keys
 * used in token validation and management processes.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The constants are organized into two main sections:
 * 1. SignatureValidation - Contains supported algorithms for token validation
 * 2. Storage - Contains keys used for storing token-related data
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Using signature validation algorithms
 * const algorithms = TokenConstants.SignatureValidation.SUPPORTED_ALGORITHMS;
 *
 * // Using storage keys
 * const timerKey = TokenConstants.Storage.StorageKeys.REFRESH_TOKEN_TIMER;
 * ```
