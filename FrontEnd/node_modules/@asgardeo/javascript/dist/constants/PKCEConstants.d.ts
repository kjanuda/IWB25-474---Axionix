 * @remarks
 * PKCE is an extension to the authorization code flow to prevent CSRF and
 * authorization code injection attacks. The constants are organized into
 * storage-related sections for managing PKCE state.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Using storage keys
 * const codeVerifierKey = PKCEConstants.Storage.StorageKeys.CODE_VERIFIER;
 * const separator = PKCEConstants.Storage.StorageKeys.SEPARATOR;
 * ```
