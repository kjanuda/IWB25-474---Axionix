 * Constants for OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange operations.

 * with actual values during request processing. They help in creating
 * flexible and reusable token exchange configurations.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Using placeholders in a token exchange template
 * const template = `grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange&subject_token=${TokenExchangeConstants.Placeholders.TOKEN}`;
 * ```
